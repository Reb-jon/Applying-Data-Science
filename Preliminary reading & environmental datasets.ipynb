    "- Random forest\n",
    "Random forest is able to capture complex patterns in data, and has been used in credit scoring models in the past:\n",
    "  - \"A Comparison of Random Forest and Logistic Regression Models in Credit Scoring of Rural Households\" - Study evaluating the performance of logistic regression and random forest models for credit scoring in rural vietnamese households. The findings indicate that the random forest model outperforms logistic regression in predictive accuracy. This suggests banks use the random forest to predict credit risk based on the existing client dataset resulting in saving time and cost to find potential clients.

    "- Overview of methods\n",
    "  - \"Machine Learning for Credit Risk Prediction: A Systematic Literature Review\" - This review examines various machine learning methods applied to credit risk prediction. It highlights the effectiveness of deep learning models and ensemble methods over traditional statistical approaches. It also discusses the need for consistent datasets (doi = 10.20944/preprints202308.0947.v1)\n",
    "  - \"The Impact of Feature Selection and Transformation on Machine Learning Methods in Determining the Credit Scoring\" - This paper examines how feature selection and data transformation influence the performance of machine learning models in credit scoring. It provides an extensive comparison of eight machine learning methods, analyzing their accuracy and the effects of different preprocessing techniques. \n",
    "    Main Findings:\n",
    "     1. Model Performance with Feature Selection:\n",
    "     - Incorporating feature selection methods enhances the predictive accuracy of machine learning models in assessing default risk.\n",
    "     2. Impact of Data Scaling:\n",
    "     - The combination of appropriate data scaling methods with feature selection significantly improves model performance.- Proper scaling ensures that features contribute proportionately, preventing dominance by features with larger numerical ranges.\n",
    "     3. Optimal Combinations:\n",
    "     - models like XGBoost and Random Forest, when paired with tailored feature selection and scaling, achieved notable performance improvements.\n",
    "     4. Top-Performing Models:\n",
    "     - Among the evaluated models, XGBoost and Random Forest consistently outperformed others in predicting default risk. - These models, when combined with tailored feature selection and scaling methods, achieved the highest validation indicators, including accuracy rate, Type I and II errors, and Area Under the Curve (AUC). Scaling techniques used were Standardization / Z-score normalization (This method transforms data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, ensuring that features contribute equally to the model), Min-Max Scaling (This technique scales data to a specified range, typically [0, 1], preserving the relationships between features while normalizing their scales) and Robust Scaling (This approach uses statistics that are robust to outliers, such as the median and interquartile range, to scale the data, making it less sensitive to outliers).

    "Data Quality Assessment:\n",
    "  - The author examined the data for erroneous values, missing values, and outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "Outlier Treatment:\n",
    "The paper notes significant variability in the Taiwan dataset variables, necessitating outlier treatment. \n",
    "Several approaches were discussed:\n",
    "  - Min-Max Normalization: Compressing data into a range between 0 and 1 using equation: x'i = (xi - min(x))/(max(x) - min(x))\n",
    "  - Z-score Standardization: Converting variables to standard normal with mean 0, standard deviation 1\n",
    "  - Winsorization: Capping extreme values at specific percentiles (e.g., 1st and 99th)\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis Steps:\n",
    "  - The author performed variable selection using Weight of Evidence (WoE) and Information Value (IV) measures to determine which variables had predictive power\n",
    "  - The dataset was split into training (70%) and testing (30%) samples\n",
    "  - Multiple model types were tested, including logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, neural networks, and support vector machines\n",
    "\n",
    "Results:\n",
    "  - For the Taiwan dataset, gradient boosting performed best with a ROC AUC of 76.7% and PR AUC of 63.4%\n",
    "  - The author found that the most important variable in predicting default was PAY_0 (recent payment status) across different modeling methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The Taiwan dataset was one of three used in the study to show that machine learning models generally outperform traditional logistic regression for credit card default prediction, though the degree of improvement varied across datasets."
